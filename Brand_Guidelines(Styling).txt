# Brand & Styling Guidelines

These guidelines define the visual and typographic system for the website. They are meant to be **simple, consistent, and scalable**, especially when working with **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## 1. Brand Personality

**Tone:** Professional
**Energy:** Medium (calm confidence, not flashy)
**Audience:** Design professionals, potential clients, and familiar collaborators

**Brand Feel:**

* Clean, composed, and modern
* Serious but not cold
* Designed to communicate trust, clarity, and competence

---

## 2. Typography System

### Font Stack

**Primary Font (UI + Content):**

* **Jost** – used for headings, body text, navigation, and UI labels

**Secondary / Legacy Fonts (Optional / Contextual):**

* Times New Roman – avoid unless needed for editorial or document-style content
* Lato – avoid unless required for legacy sections

> Recommendation: Standardize entirely on **Jost** for visual consistency.

### Type Hierarchy

| Element | Size                  | Usage                      |
| ------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| H1      | 35px                  | Page titles, main sections |
| H2      | 19px                  | Subsections, card titles   |
| Body    | 16–18px (recommended) | Paragraphs, descriptions   |

> Note: A 36px body size is visually heavy for web. Use **16–18px** for readability and reserve larger sizes for headings.

---

### Font Weights

* Regular (400): Body text
* Medium (500): UI labels, navigation
* Semibold (600): Headings

Avoid excessive bolding to maintain a professional tone.

## 3. Color System

### Core Palette

| Role       | Color   | Usage                             |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| Text       | #e8e6e3 | Primary text on dark backgrounds  |
| Background | #282c2e | Main page background              |
| Primary    | #eaedf0 | Headlines, key UI elements        |
| Secondary  | #181a1b | Cards, sections, nav bars         |
| Accent     | #6d767e | Borders, icons, subtle highlights |

---

### Color Usage Rules

* Use **Text** color for all readable content
* Use **Primary** sparingly for emphasis and hierarchy
* Accent should never overpower primary content
* Avoid introducing new colors unless absolutely necessary

Contrast is optimized for dark-mode readability.

---

## 4. Spacing & Layout

### Base Spacing Unit

* **Base Unit:** 10px

All spacing should be multiples of this unit:

* 10px (xs)
* 20px (sm)
* 30px (md)
* 40px (lg)
* 60px (xl)

This creates visual rhythm and consistency.

---

### Border Radius

* **Standard Radius:** 12px

Apply to:

* Cards
* Buttons
* Inputs
* Modals

Avoid mixing radius sizes to keep the UI clean.

---

## 5. UI Principles

### Buttons

* Subtle, solid backgrounds
* Clear hover state (slight brightness or contrast change)
* Rounded with 12px radius

### Cards & Containers

* Use Secondary color for surfaces
* Maintain generous padding (20–30px)
* Minimal shadows or none at all

### Interactions

* Animations should be subtle and purposeful
* Prefer fades, small translations, and opacity changes
* Avoid playful or exaggerated motion

---

## 6. Tailwind CSS Configuration (Reference)

```js
colors: {
  text: '#e8e6e3',
  background: '#282c2e',
  primary: '#eaedf0',
  secondary: '#181a1b',
  accent: '#6d767e',
}
```

### Tailwind Usage Guidelines

* Use semantic utility combinations
* Avoid inline styles
* Prefer consistent spacing utilities (e.g. `p-4`, `gap-4`)
* Keep class lists readable and intentional

---

## 7. Overall Design Rules (Do / Don’t)

### Do

* Keep layouts clean and breathable
* Use hierarchy instead of decoration
* Let typography do most of the work

### Don’t

* Overuse accent colors
* Mix font families unnecessarily
* Use loud gradients or flashy effects

---

## Final Brand Summary

This brand system communicates:

* Professionalism
* Calm confidence
* Design maturity

It is intentionally restrained so the **content and work speak louder than the styling**.
